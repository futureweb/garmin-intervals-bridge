"""When to look for new activities.

  - BRIDGE_POLL_SECONDS (5 minutes by default) is the pace; inside BRIDGE_POLL_HOURS only.
  - Outside those hours the bridge does not look at all – or, with BRIDGE_POLL_QUIET_SECONDS,
    every so often.
  - For an hour after a new activity, or after "Check now" on the web page, it looks at the
    fast pace again – a second session, the cool-down run – quiet hours or not (silent quiet
    hours stay silent).
  - BRIDGE_POLL_MODE=adaptive learns from the archive when your activities usually end: fast
    then, a middle pace around those hours, the quiet pace (30 minutes by default) otherwise.

The full runs go on regardless, so nothing is missed; it may only come in later. The same
decision serves `run` and the systemd timer (which starts `watch` every minute; a `watch`
that is not due ends at once, without a request).
