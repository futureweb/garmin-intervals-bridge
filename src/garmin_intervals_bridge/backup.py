"""Backup mode (BRIDGE_MODE=backup, `run --mode backup`, `backup`): your Garmin Connect data
on your own disk – no Intervals.icu needed, nothing written anywhere but the data folder.

What it keeps, in the data folder:
  fits/<id>.fit                  every activity's original recording, as the device made it
  raw/activities/<id>.json       Garmin's summary of it; <id>.extras.json weather, gear,
                                 exercise sets, Garmin's own splits
  raw/<day>.json                 each day's wellness: the full answers of every Garmin endpoint
                                 (sleep, HRV, stress, Body Battery, readiness, scores …)
  wellness-files/<day>.zip       the watch's original wellness files (monitoring, sleep, HRV,
                                 Health Snapshots), as Garmin hands them out; <day>.json lists them
  raw/account/<date>.json        weekly: profile, devices, zones, records, badges, workouts,
                                 plans, calendar

When, kindly to Garmin: a run every BRIDGE_BACKUP_HOURS (12) – new activities (one list
request, a download per new one); a day's wellness once it is final – at the first run after
noon of the next day – and once more three days later for a watch that synced late (about
60 requests per day); the account once a week.
`backup --from DATE` fills in the past, resumably.
