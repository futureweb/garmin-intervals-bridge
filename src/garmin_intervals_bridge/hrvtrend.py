"""Experimental: training advice from the HRV trend, as in the HRV-guided training studies.

ImReady4 judges each morning's single values. The studies that guided training by HRV
mostly judged a week: the 7-day mean of ln(rMSSD) against an individual normal range
(baseline mean ± 0.5 SD, the "smallest worthwhile change"; Plews et al. 2012/2013,
Vesterinen et al. 2016, Javaloyes et al. 2019), with a quicker rule for two bad days in a
row (Kiviniemi et al. 2007) and the night's heart rate as a second marker (Nuuttila et al.
2022 used nocturnal recordings). This module writes such an advice into a field of its
own, `HRVTrendAdvice` (same values as ImReady4's `TrainingAdvice`: 1 Rest, 2 LIT,
3 Planned, 4 HIT), so both can be compared side by side; `HRVTrendCV` holds the week's
coefficient of variation of ln(rMSSD) (Plews et al. 2012).

For a day D, with x = ln(hrv) and h = avgSleepingHR (the night's average heart rate):

  week      D-6 … D; at least 5 of the 7 nights measured, D itself included
  baseline  the 60 days before the week (D-66 … D-7); at least 30 nights measured
  band      baseline mean ± 0.5 · baseline SD (population SD), for x and for h
  rules, first match:
    1 Rest     today's x below −1 SD and today's h above +2 SD   (acute: HRV down, night HR well up)
    1 Rest     week x below the band and week h above its band   (trend: HRV down, night HR up)
    2 LIT      week x below the band                             (trend: HRV below normal)
    2 LIT      today's and yesterday's x below −1 SD, or today's below −2 SD   (acute drop)
    3 Planned  otherwise – within the normal range the studies trained as planned, hard
               sessions included; they have no "more than planned" state, so HIT is not used.
               Week x above and week h below their bands stays Planned with a note: Vesterinen
               counted it as outside the band, but mostly it is good form, and the evidence for
               parasympathetic saturation is mixed

Without enough night heart rate, the rules that need it are left out (HRV alone).
This is an experiment: none of these thresholds has been validated for this exact
combination, and the night values of a watch differ from the morning readings most
studies used.
