"""ImReady4-compatible training advice, written to Intervals' `TrainingAdvice` field.

ImReady4 is Iñigo Tolosa's MATLAB script for HRV-guided training, built on the
method and chart MedTechCD reconstructed from the ithlete training guide
(forum.intervals.icu/t/25778). Its users run it by hand every morning in MATLAB
Mobile. This module is an independent implementation of its published scoring,
version 4.43, so the bridge can do that step once the night has synced:

  input     Intervals' wellness `hrv` (rMSSD, ms) and `restingHR` (bpm), the same
            fields ImReady4 reads; one row per wellness record, newest first,
            within the 90 days up to the day
  transform HRV as 20·ln(rMSSD); resting HR as it is
  reference the 30 rows ending at the day (the day included), missing values
            left out; mean and population standard deviation (MATLAB std(x, 1))
  z-scores  (value − mean) / standard deviation, for HRV and for resting HR
  zones     ImReady4's getScore(), boundaries exactly as published
  field     HIT → 4, Normal → 3 (Planned), LIT / LIT! → 2, Rest / REST! → 1

Where this deliberately differs from the script: a day without its own HRV and
resting HR, with fewer than MIN_VALID values in the reference, or without any
variability gets no advice at all (the script sends an empty value then), and a
zero or negative value counts as missing, never as a measurement.

Validated against the reference results that come with the .NET translation of
the script (github.com/Creastoff/ImReady4.Net, produced with the original code):
30 of 30 days agree. No MATLAB code is copied here.
