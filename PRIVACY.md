# Privacy

The Garmin → Intervals.icu Bridge is software you run yourself – on your own computer,
NAS or server. There is no central service behind it, and its authors receive none of
your data.

**What it handles:** your Intervals.icu API key (or, where set up, an OAuth token), your
optional Garmin Personal API key and access token, Garmin Connect session tokens (your
Garmin password is used once to sign in and never stored), an optional HTTP trigger token, and your training and health data: activity files, wellness values, gear.

**Where it keeps it:** only in its own folder on your machine (settings file, data
folder, log), readable by you – or by the bridge's own service user – only.

**Where it sends it:** to Garmin Connect and Intervals.icu, to read and write your own
data there. Besides that, only when you set them up: your own mail server and/or an ntfy
server for alerts – a push message carries a headline only; an e-mail also the details
(which activity or day, the error) – and once a day pypi.org to look for a newer version
(no personal data; `BRIDGE_UPDATE_CHECK=false` turns it off). No analytics, no telemetry,
no third parties.

**What it deletes:** nothing – except, when you switch swap mode on with the `upload`
method, Garmin's filtered copy of a new activity in Intervals, once your original is in as
a new activity (never one with comments; nothing on Garmin Connect). Swap's default,
`replace`, puts the original into the same activity and deletes nothing.

**Removing it:** stop the bridge and delete its folder; revoke its access in
Intervals.icu (*Settings → Developer Settings*, or the connected app) and, if you like,
sign out its Garmin session and revoke the Personal API key in Garmin Connect.

Personal mode sends your key to Garmin's Personal token service and uses its access token
for reads. Optional expiry reminders go through your configured alerts and, on applying
runs, Intervals calendar notes; they never contain the key or token.
