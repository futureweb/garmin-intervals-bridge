# Security and privacy

This project handles GPS tracks, detailed medical/fitness/health metrics (including logged nutrition and sleep data), Garmin session tokens, Personal API keys/access tokens and the Intervals API key.

**Must**

- Never commit `.env`, `data/`, FIT exports, JSON snapshots, OAuth tokens, logs, or raw API responses.
- Restrict data/tokens folder permissions (0700) and backup encrypted at rest. FIT files and JSON (0600) contain personal information.
- Run as an unprivileged user: the systemd units in `deploy/` or the non-root container; keep the virtualenv outside any web document root and the data directory at mode 0700.
- Writing custom streams marks the activity's intervals as edited in Intervals (see README, known limitations); nothing is ever deleted.
- Use the Intervals API key only over HTTPS. Do not put it into CLI arguments or screenshots.
- Never paste Garmin passwords, session tokens, Intervals API keys or private FITs into public GitHub issues.
- Run `login` once in a local interactive terminal and let Garmin session tokens refresh. Do not store Garmin account password in cron or compose environment variables.
- `--verbose` makes the Garmin library log every request URL, and those URLs contain your Garmin display name. Use it for troubleshooting, not in a scheduled unit, and treat the journal as private.
- Keep remote writes behind explicit `--apply` and `--allow-activity-upload`; audit the difference before enabling them.
- The bridge deletes nothing – with one opt-in exception: swap mode with the `upload` method (`BRIDGE_SWAP=true` with `BRIDGE_SWAP_METHOD=upload`, or `swap <id> --method upload --apply`) deletes the filtered copy that Garmin's import created in Intervals – never anything on Garmin Connect, which the bridge only reads – after its original has been uploaded and the athlete's values carried over; never with comments or hand-edited intervals on it, never before the upload succeeded.
- Keep Garmin official wellness import if useful; only disable the overlapping *activity* import after proven testing.
- Do not auto-resubmit a pending FIT upload without checking Intervals for the activity. Upload requests may have succeeded even after a network timeout.
- `setup` reads the API key without echoing it and writes the settings file readable by its owner only (0600); keep `~/GarminBridge` (settings, log, data) private and out of cloud-synced folders you share.
- The web page (`ui`, or `BRIDGE_UI_PORT` next to `run`): on 127.0.0.1 a random key in the link; anywhere else only with `BRIDGE_UI_PASSWORD` (8+ characters, the templates' placeholder refused). It is plain http – keep it in your home network or behind an HTTPS reverse proxy, never expose the port to the internet. Forms carry per-session CSRF tokens, local pages check the Host header (DNS rebinding), strict CSP, no caching or framing. The Garmin password typed there goes to Garmin only; the API key is never shown.
- Alerts: the mailbox password (`BRIDGE_SMTP_PASSWORD`, ideally an app password that can only send) lives in the settings file like the API key; mail is sent with TLS. An ntfy topic name is a secret (anyone who knows it can read its messages): use a long random one, as `setup` does; push messages carry the headline only, never details.
- The bridge connects to Garmin Connect, Intervals.icu and, once a day for the update hint, pypi.org (`BRIDGE_UPDATE_CHECK=false` turns that off); when alerts are set up, your mail server and/or the ntfy server. No telemetry.

Personal keys are sent only to Garmin's Personal token endpoint. Access tokens are kept in a
separate private cache; diagnostic output omits credential and JWT claim values. JWT decoding
is used only to schedule renewal, never to verify account identity. Proxy and custom CA settings
are honored, .netrc authentication and redirects are disabled. Treat the private failure cache,
settings and health archives as sensitive too. See [Personal API](docs/PERSONAL_API.md).

**Limitations**

- Garmin endpoints are unofficial/private, may change and may have access restrictions and anti-automation protection; honor their rules.
- The optional `BRIDGE_UI_TRIGGER_TOKEN` is a separate secret of at least 24 characters. It authorizes only `POST /trigger/poll-now`, using `Authorization: Bearer <token>` without a web session. Keep it out of URLs and logs, and use the UI's private network or HTTPS access. Empty disables it; invalid configuration disables only the trigger and shows a warning. The endpoint is rate limited, still checks Host, and is unavailable through Home Assistant ingress. Normal forms still require their session and CSRF token.
- FIT header validation is structural, not a cryptographic signature or complete FIT semantic/CRC validation. For deeper checks use `compare-fit` with `fitparse` and a verified Garmin web download.
- Existing wellness values are preserved, but concurrently changing server-side custom fields between GET and PUT can theoretically race; this is not a transactional multiwriter merge.
- Automatic retry is limited to GET requests; a failed write might still have taken effect, and the app avoids replaying activity uploads automatically.
- Synthetic tests cannot prove Garmin session tokens or Intervals API data shapes; see README acceptance checklist before release.

**Reporting vulnerabilities**

If publishing a public GitHub repo, set up private security advisories / vulnerability reporting first. Avoid posting tokens or customer data.
